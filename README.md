Hi, I’m Alice!
I'm not completely new to programming, but I definitely consider myself a beginner.
I’m currently learning JavaScript, but I'm still unsure about my learning path. 
I would love to collaborate on something one day, but for now I'm just sticking to learning basics and doing some small projects on my own.
